    "Of course, dividing the city in 10 parts of similar city doesn't tell us everything about how the population is distributed in Toronto. For this reason I will also extract data about demographics from another wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Toronto_neighbourhoods' and get a table where the neighbourhoods are ordered by population.\n",
